# DarkVerse

DarkVerse is a modular Python packagea developed during my Master thesis to
process large observational datasets, measure galaxy clustering and apply
halo occupation distribution (HOD) model fitting. It provides tools for:
• Data Selection: Tools to select and manipulate galaxy catalogs,
including stellar mass ranges and redshift selections.
• Clustering Analysis: Functions to compute angular correlation functions using the
TreeCorr library, galaxy bias, correlation length.
• Halo Modeling: Implementation of the three-parameter model
HOD to fit the data, using the halomod package
